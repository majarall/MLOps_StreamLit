This document provides an overview of the transformer models and streamlit application.

## Transformer models

Transformer models, also known as transformers, are a type of deep learning model used primarily in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language translation, question answering, and text summarization. The transformer architecture was introduced in a 2017 paper by Vaswani et al. and has since become a popular choice for NLP tasks due to its ability to handle long-range dependencies and its parallelizability.

The most famous transformer model is the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It is a pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and named entity recognition.

## Streamlit application

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows developers to quickly create interactive web applications for machine learning and data science. The streamlit application included in this project provides a user interface to interact with the pre-trained BERT model.

The application allows the user to enter a piece of text and see the model's prediction for sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis predicts whether the text has a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

To run the streamlit application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the command `streamlit run app.py` in your command prompt or terminal.
3. Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Conclusion

The transformer models and streamlit application provide an easy way to perform NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. With the popularity of transformers in NLP, these tools are becoming increasingly important for developers and data scientists.
